# K-Means Clustering on Two Moons

This project implements the K-Means algorithm from scratch to visualize its performance on non-spherical datasets (the "Two Moons" dataset).

## Features
- Custom K-Means engine (no using Sklearn's KMeans class).
- Visualization of initial vs. final centroid states.
- Automated export to PNG.

## Results
